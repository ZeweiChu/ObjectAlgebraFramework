> This paper describes an extension to object algebras to support
> adaptive object-oriented programming (AOOD, aka scrapping your
> boilerplate SYB in ICFP-land).  After an introduction to the paper as
> a whole, section 2 gives background and then section 3 introduces Shy,
> the author's extension that supports AOOOD.  Sections 4 and 5 then
> extends the basic algebras to support more complex queries, and
> sections 6 and 7 then discuss more complex transformations.  As, all

> algebras (languages) with more constructors (AST node types), and
> section 9 revisits the QL running example including a basic
> performance assessment. Section 10 discusses related work and 11

> Object Algebras. Object Algebras is an OOP design pattern for programming 
> expressions in a way inspired by functional programming: an operation is 
> represented as an "algebra" object with methods corresponding to constructors 
> for an expression tree. The constructors are called on the algebra object as 
> if the tree was being built, but instead of building the tree, the result of 
> the operation is computed. Using this encoding, the Expession Problem can be 
> solved (although not in a general way, see below), as has been shown in 
> previous papers.
> 
> Boilerplate traversal code is common for expression problems: it is common 
> that many node types just delegate a computation to the children in some 
> simple pattern, and only a few node types do something of real interest.
> 
> The paper shows how such boilerplate code can be factored out to Java 8 
> interfaces with default methods, for the Object Algebra solution. A number 
> of different kinds of boilerplate interfaces are discussed, for supporting 
> different kinds of queries and transformations, for example queries that 
> aggregate information from their children. A Java framework, Shy, has been 
> implemented that supports an annotation @Algebra on the algebra classes, 
> and that automatically generates these boilerplate interfaces.
> 
> The Shy framework is evaluated by implementing some queries and transformations 
> for the language QL, which is a DSL that has previously been used in a tool 
> challenge. The performance is measured and compared to a "vanilla" OOP solution 
> that uses similar boilerplate interfaces (I think). In looking at the diagrams, 
> it looks like Shy is around 1.2x slower than Vanilla for queries, and around

> 
> The paper integrates two branches of research. Object algebras are an 
> approach to solving the expression problem in object-oriented programming 
> languages. Generic (structure-shy/strategic) programming aims to reduce 
> the overhead in traversing data structures by capturing the default case 
> that applies to most constructors of the data type. For example, combine 
> the results returned for each of the child nodes. This paper combines the 
> two approaches in Java by generating default traversals for queries and 
> transformations from the declaration of the interface of an object algebra 
> driven by a simple @Algebra annotation on the interface. Implementations 
> of concrete traversals need only extend the generated default implementations 
> and override just those methods that do not follow the default pattern. 
> The paper motivates the work by setting up regular OO and object algebra 
> examples, then carefully explains the construction of the query and 
> transformation algebras, and how they are used. The design is illustrated 
> and benchmarked using the QL benchmark DSL. The related work does (mostly) 
> a nice job in outlining the rich history of generic programming that leads 
> up to this work.
